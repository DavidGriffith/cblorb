# Configuration file for inweb

# The following command is assumed to open a PDF file in the host OS; it
# works on Mac OS X, at any rate. An inweb weave opens a just-made PDF
# by default if this is non-null; using the -open or -closed options can
# toggle this behaviour, though.

open-command = open

# This is the standard Mac OS X location of pdftext, the tool for setting
# TeX-to-PDF, following installation from the LiveTeX distribution:

pdftex = pdftex

# The usual way that Mac OS X users have dot, the graph-generating tool,
# installed is by having the GraphViz application installed - the tool itself
# lives inside that application's bundle. So:

dot = /Applications/GraphViz.app/Contents/MacOS/dot
